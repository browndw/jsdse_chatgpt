published-S0006320715000488	The major role of tropical forests in biodiversity and climate change has led the world to search for effective ways to slow deforestation. Many approaches have come in and out of fashion. Strictly protected areas, which prohibit most human activities, were popular in the early days of conservation and remain so today. As an alternative to strict protected areas, Community Forest Management (CFM) emerged in the late 1980s (Hutton et al., 2005). By virtue of involving local forest users in management, CFM is promoted as having the potential to benefit both forests and local livelihoods (Behera, 2009). This potential, however, has been questioned (Behera, 2009) and its evidence base has been found to be weak (Bowler et al., 2012). Although Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) have become the most recent fashion in efforts to reduce deforestation, CFM remains an important part of the forest management toolkit in many developing countries (Blaikie, 2006). It is also promoted as a means by which PES schemes can be implemented. High quality studies evaluating the effectiveness of CFM are therefore important for shaping future development and investment in approaches to reduce deforestation. We aim to provide robust evidence on effectiveness of CFM at reducing deforestation. Studies investigating the effectiveness of conservation interventions often fail to adequately control for confounding factors that affect both the assignment of interventions and the outcomes of interest (Bowler et al., 2012; Ferraro and Pattanayak, 2006; Joppa and Pfaff, 2010). Recent studies investigating the effectiveness of protected areas at reducing deforestation have made progress in controlling for confounding factors by the use of statistical matching (e.g. Andam et al., 2013, 2008; Carranza et al., 2014; Ferraro et al., 2013). Matching selects comparison areas that have pre-intervention baseline values of confounding factors most similar to intervention area values, and thus makes it possible to control for these confounding factors (Joppa and Pfaff, 2011). However, we know of only one study (Somanathan et al., 2009) that has used matching to investigate the effectiveness of CFM at reducing deforestation. A significant challenge for evaluating the effectiveness of CFM is the large variation in forest management practices and designs within the approach, both among and within countries (Lund et al., 2009). In terms of practices, examples of this variation range from cases where the community has a good understanding of their rights and responsibilities to cases where CFM exists on paper only (Benjamin, 2008; Lund et al., 2009). An example of design variation is that some CFMs allow communities to benefit from commercial use of forest resources within their managed forests while others do not (Persha et al., 2011). Failure to consider this variation compromises the potential for learning about design and implementation factors that promote CFM effectiveness. The Malagasy government legislated CFM in the late 1990s (Raik, 2007) to reduce deforestation and protect the significant part of the world’s biodiversity that is endemic to Madagascar (Le Saout et al., 2013). The number of CFM units increased rapidly and continues to grow (Aubert et al., 2013). Many publications review the institutional and political aspects of Madagascar’s forest decentralization process (Pollini et al., 2014; Pollini and Lassoie, 2011; Raik and Decker, 2007; Rives et al., 2013; Urech et al., 2013), but only a few focus on empirically estimating the performance of CFM in terms of conservation outcomes (CIRAD, 2013; Sommerville et al., 2010; Toillier et al., 2011). None adequately control for factors that may confound impact estimates. Using statistical matching to control for factors that confound impact estimates, we investigate the effectiveness of Madagascar CFM at reducing deforestation between 2000 and 2010. To our knowledge, this is the first national scale study of performance of CFM at delivering conservation outcomes. First, we assess the overall effectiveness of Madagascar’s forest decentralization policy at reducing deforestation by looking at all CFM units across the country. Second, we distinguish and study effectiveness in a subsample of CFM units where we have information to suggest that CFM was implemented on the ground. Finally, we differentiate between CFM that allows and does not allow commercial use of forest resources and study effectiveness conditional on whether CFM permits or prohibits commercial use. Note that we do not consider other important potential outcomes from CFM including impacts, positive or negative, on human welfare.
published-S0006899318305754	Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death among Americans and a leading cause of major disability. One of the most damaging types of ischemic stroke, an emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO), occurs when a thrombus impedes blood flow in a major cerebral artery. ELVO patients have a high mortality rate, and survivors are often left with profound deficits in motor and cognitive function (Malhotra et al., 2017). Intravenous administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the only FDA-approved drug for ischemic stroke, is often ineffective in ELVO patients (Broderick et al., 2013; Ciccone et al., 2013; Kidwell et al., 2013), and others are unable to undergo endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). The permanent intraluminal middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke best represents ELVO without tPA administration or EVT. This model provides the opportunity to discover new treatments to decrease mortality and disability resulting from ELVO. Treating large vessel stroke in rats requires an agent that promotes neuroprotection and reduces peripheral inflammation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cytokine in the IL-6 family, has shown efficacy in animal models for neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Previous groups demonstrated that LIF reduces neurodegeneration through pro-survival PI3K/Akt signaling and by promoting the development of anti-inflammatory leukocytes (Azari et al., 2001; Butzkueven et al., 2002, 2006; Duluc et al., 2007; Janssens et al., 2015; Slaets et al., 2008; Suzuki et al., 2005). This laboratory has shown that systemic LIF administration is effective in reducing infarct volume and improving functional recovery after MCAO (Rowe et al., 2014). This drug regimen entails an initial dose delivered intravenously starting at 6 h after MCAO followed by additional doses at 24 and 48 h with euthanization at 72 h. This regimen was initiated to be clinically relevant and to encompass the neuroinflammatory-induced neurodegeneration that occurs at 48 h in this model (Leonardo et al., 2010). LIF protects neurons and oligodendrocytes from an ischemic environment through the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes (Davis et al., 2017; Rowe et al., 2014). LIF is also an anti-inflammatory cytokine that promotes the development of an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and T helper cells (Duluc et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2009; Janssens et al., 2015; Metcalfe et al., 2015). These combined actions lead to improved histological and functional outcomes in this severe stroke model. Neuroprotective signaling begins with LIF binding to the LIF receptor (LIFR), a 190 kDa member of the type 1 cytokine receptor family (Gadina et al., 2001). To confer downstream signaling, LIFR must be localized to the plasma membrane and near other IL-6 cytokine receptor components. Besides LIF, this receptor transduces signals of two other cellular protective proteins, cardiotropin-1 and ciliary neurotrophic factor. This receptor is unusual in that it resides in the nuclei of neuronal cells until an injury occurs (Davis et al., 2017; Gardiner et al., 2002; Zhao et al., 2014). While LIFR plays a crucial role in transducing signals for these protective factors, the molecular and cellular roles of this receptor are not entirely understood. Until now, pre-clinical studies aimed at promoting post-stroke recovery have primarily utilized primarily young male rodents. Unfortunately, results from these studies have not led to success in clinical trials. We have reported favorable results with the administration of LIF as a neuroprotective agent in young male rats (Davis et al., 2017; Konoeda et al., 2010; Rowe et al., 2014). In this study, we utilized the same drug regimen and experimental design using aged (18 mo) rats of both sexes. Our study shows that LIF treatment is less effective at promoting neuroprotection after MCAO in aged rats of both sexes, which coincides with significantly lower LIFR expression in the brain compared to young rats.
published-S0009279717306439	It is common knowledge that any compound becomes toxic when its exposure exceeds a certain threshold. Nowadays it is also realized that exposure below this threshold induces an adaptive response, often referred to as hormesis. The nature of the adaptive response depends on time. For example, adaptation by activation of protective enzymes provides direct protection and is critical for survival of an acute exposure, while evolutionary adaptation provides long term protection and occurs when there is a long-lasting change in exposure, e.g. the introduction of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere [1]. An elegant example of direct adaptation is the increase of glutathione S-transferase activity by acrolein [2]. Acrolein (propenal) is the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde. It is present in e.g. cigarette smoke and diesel exhaust [3]. In addition, it is formed endogenously e.g. during lipid peroxidation [3]. Due to its soft electrophilic character, acrolein readily adducts soft nucleophilic thiols present in cysteine residues of proteins [4]. The latter accounts for the toxicity of acrolein. In the protection against acrolein and other electrophiles, glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role [5]. The thiol group in GSH spontaneously reacts with these electrophiles. The GSH transferases catalyze this detoxification reaction of GSH, and therefore increase the protection by GSH [6,7]. GSH transferases are present in the cytosol, mitochondria and microsomes. Microsomal GSH transferases (MGST) belong to the MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and GSH metabolism) superfamily. They are involved in drug detoxification and play an important role in leukotriene and prostaglandin E synthesis [6,7]. Addition of acrolein to microsomes can increase GSH transferase activity 2–3 fold [2]. This is an acute adaptive response, since acrolein directly enhances its conjugation with GSH and thus its detoxification [2]. It is known that in MGST1 the thiol group of cysteine 49 is adducted by electrophiles, and this adduction increases the activity of the enzyme [6,8]. It has been speculated that in this way MGST becomes activated when it is needed, i.e. when alkylating electrophiles are to be detoxified by GSH-conjugation [2,9]. Preliminary results indicated that acrolein also can inhibit MGST activity. This was seen with relatively high concentrations of acrolein. This prompted us to further elaborate on the effect of acrolein on MGST activity, and to evaluate how this two faced effect of acrolein fits in the cellular response to this toxin, that – by increasing the level of exposure - progresses from protection into adaptation and finally toxicity.
published-S0010945218302843	Detection of new events within a constantly fluctuating sensory input is a fundamental challenge to organisms in dynamic environments. Hypothesized to underlie this process is a continually-refined internal model of the real-world causes of sensations, made possible by exploiting statistical structure in the sensory input (Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Friston & Kiebel, 2009; Rubin, Ulanovsky, Nelken, & Tishby, 2016; Winkler, Denham, & Nelken, 2009). Evidence from multiple domains, including speech (Saffran, Aslin, & Newport, 1996), abstract sound sequences (McDermott, Schemitsch, & Simoncelli, 2013; Paavilainen et al., 2013; Saffran, Johnson, Aslin, & Newport, 1999), vision (Turk-Browne, Scholl, Chun, & Johnson, 2009) and motor control (Bestmann et al., 2008) reveals sensitivity to environmental statistics, which in turn influences top-down, expectation-driven perceptual processing. When the organism encounters sensory input that is inconsistent with the established internal model, a ‘surprise’ response is generated (Friston, 2005), promoting a rapid reaction to the associated environmental change. Understanding what aspects of stimuli are ‘surprising’, and how they are processed, is therefore central to understanding this network. The auditory system has been a fertile ground for probing sensory error responses, at multiple levels of the processing hierarchy (Aghamolaei, Zarnowiec, Grimm, & Escera, 2016; Ayala, Pérez-González, & Malmierca, 2016; Nelken, 2014; Parras et al., 2017). A common approach involves using a stream of standard sounds to establish a regularity that is occasionally interrupted by ‘deviant’ sounds (Garrido, Kilner, Stephan, & Friston, 2009, 2008; Heilbron & Chait, 2017; Khouri & Nelken, 2015; Näätänen & Alho, 1995). Deviants usually evoke an increased response relative to that measured for the standards (Garrido et al., 2009; Herrmann, Henry, Fromboluti, McAuley, & Obleser, 2015; Ulanovsky, Las, & Nelken, 2003). Since many of the investigated sequences have been very simple, often a repeated tone; neural adaptation is likely a major contributor to the observed deviant responses (Briley & Krumbholz, 2013; Grill-Spector, Henson, & Martin, 2006; Nelken, 2014). However, accumulating evidence suggests that at least part of the deviant response arises from neural processes associated with computing ‘surprise’ or detecting a mismatch between expected and actual sensory input (Daikhin & Ahissar, 2012; Khouri & Nelken, 2015; Parras et al., 2017; Taaseh, Yaron, & Nelken, 2011). The underlying network, consistently implicated in these processes, is comprised of bilateral auditory cortex (Heschl's Gyrus and superior temporal gyrus) and right inferior frontal gyrus (Barascud, Pearce, Griffiths, Friston, & Chait, 2016; Chennu et al., 2016; Garrido et al., 2009, 2008; Heilbron & Chait, 2017; Opitz, Rinne, Mecklinger, Cramon von, & Schröger, 2002). What information is used in calculating surprise? Mounting evidence suggests that the deviant response is shaped by the statistics of the sequence as it unfolds. Garrido, Sahani, and Dolan (2013) demonstrated that MEG responses to probe tones are sensitive to the statistical context (mean and variance of frequency) of randomly generated tone-pip sequences such that larger responses occurred to the same probe tone when presented in a context with low-variance than with high-variance. Rubin et al. (2016) modelled brain responses to two-tone sequences with different probabilities. They demonstrated, in line with conclusions from Garrido et al. (2013), that trial-wise neural responses in auditory cortex are well explained by the probability of occurrence of each tone frequency, calculated from the recent history of the sequence. The models that best fit neural responses were based on a relatively long stimulus history (∼10 tones); but maintained a coarse representation, reflecting a small set of summary statistics. Most previous work investigating the effect of context on deviant processing has focused on simple, random frequency patterns (Garrido et al., 2013; Herrmann et al., 2015; Khouri & Nelken, 2015). For these signals, a coarse representation, possibly underpinned by adaptation processes (Herrmann et al., 2015; Khouri & Nelken, 2015; May & Tiitinen, 2010), may indeed be sufficient to capture relevant attributes. However, it remains unclear whether the brain also keeps track of a detailed history of past sensory experience. To reveal these processes, the stimulus must contain some structural regularity. Whilst previous research (Koelsch, Gunter, Friederici, & Schröger, 2000; Koelsch, Busch, Jentschke, Rohrmeier, & 2016; Maess, Koelsch, Gunter, & Friederici, 2001; Pearce, Ruiz, Kapasi, Wiggins, & Bhattacharya, 2010; Vaz Pato, Jones, Perez, & Sprague, 2002), investigated complex sequence structure, the experiments mostly involved fixed patterns and exposure over very long durations, likely reflecting long-term structure learning. In contrast, here we focus on structure which emerges anew in each sequence. We seek to understand whether the brain represents this structure, and identify the underlying brain networks. We used fast tone-pip sequences, unique on each trial, that occasionally contained a frequency outlier presented outside of the spectral region occupied by the standards. To determine whether the deviant response merely reflects an unexpected change in frequency between the standards and outlier, or whether it is also affected by the specific order of elements in the sequence, we used as standards either regular (REG) or random (RAND) sequences of otherwise matched frequencies (see Fig. 1), such that the frequency span is identical but the precision of the available information regarding successive frequencies is either low (RAND) or high (REG). Notably, the sound sequences were very rapid (20 tones per second) such that conscious reasoning about the sequence order is unlikely to be possible. Based on the hypothesis that the human brain tracks and evaluates incoming sensory information against the specific pattern established by the sequence context, we expect outlier tones to be more readily detectable in REG than in RAND sequences. The experiments reported below investigate this assertion by measuring deviance-evoked EEG responses in naïve, distracted listeners (Experiment 1) and when listeners actively monitored the sequences for outlier tones (Experiment 2).
published-S0012821X15000709	Seawater circulation through, and reaction with, the ocean crust is a fundamental Earth process that controls the magmatic accretion of new oceanic crust, modifies the composition of ocean crust and seawater, and through subduction transports surficial geochemical signatures to the mantle. At mid ocean ridges (MOR) hydrothermal circulation is most spectacularly expressed as high temperature (up to 400 °C) vent fluids, but at the ridge axis and ridge flanks, lower temperature (<150 °C) hydrothermal circulation is also important. Because vent fluids provide only limited information on the subsurface, we require improved knowledge on sub-surface fluid flow pathways, and the vigour and longevity of seafloor hydrothermal alteration to further understand magmatic accretion at MOR (e.g., Henstock et al., 1993; Kelemen et al., 1997) and better quantify the influence of seawater-basalt exchange on global chemical cycles (e.g., Vance et al., 2009). To date, much of our knowledge of MOR hydrothermal circulation is reflected by conceptual cartoons developed from active and passive seismic observations (e.g., Kent et al., 1990; Tolstoy et al., 2008), measurements of vent fluid chemistry, thermal models, and core descriptions from ocean crust “reference site” DSDP Hole 504B (Alt, 1995). Unfortunately, observations from ophiolites appear inappropriate for MOR hydrothermal systems (e.g., Alt and Teagle, 2000; Bickle and Teagle, 1992), so key questions remain unresolved principally due to a dearth of direct information from intact ocean crust. For example, many sketches of MOR hydrothermal circulation indicate focused lateral fluid movement along the top of axial magma chambers, but to date there is only limited evidence for such flow. Sheeted sill-type models of ocean crust accretion require deep hydrothermal fluid circulation to remove latent and sensible heat from the lower crust (Maclennan et al., 2004) but the conduits for the downwelling of cool seawater-derived fluid remain elusive. Borehole observations and sampling by scientific ocean drilling is essential to better understand ocean floor hydrothermal systems but the paucity of deep holes into ocean crust limits our knowledge of seafloor basalt-hydrothermal alteration. Here we present a high spatial resolution whole rock and mineral Sr isotope profile for ODP Site 1256, the first borehole to sample a complete section down to gabbros of intact upper ocean crust formed at a fast spreading rate (Teagle et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2006). Our interpretations from this profile are tightly integrated with detailed petrography and geochemistry of the drill cores (Alt et al., 2010; Teagle et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2003) and borehole wireline observations (Tominaga et al., 2009; Tominaga and Umino, 2010). We document sub-horizontal and sub-vertical channelling of seawater-derived hydrothermal fluids at different levels in the ocean crust, and develop a temporal model for the evolving hydrothermal system at Site 1256.
published-S0012821X19306843	Erosion drives the transfer of Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) to geological basins, where its long-term preservation is helped by rapid burial and/or anoxic conditions (France-Lanord and Derry, 1997; Galy et al., 2007; Hilton et al., 2015; Walsh et al., 1981). This is a key feature of the global carbon cycle, syphoning large amounts of atmospheric carbon into the lithosphere. Erosion also exposes previously buried petrogenic carbon (OCpetro) at the Earth's surface, promoting the release of CO2 via microbial or chemical degradation (Hemingway et al., 2018; Petsch et al., 2000). For the organic pathway to carbon sequestration to be effective on geological time scales, a net transfer has to occur from the atmosphere-surface system into geological storage. Although this transfer appears to be efficient in mountain belts where short, steep transport lines connect source and sink (Galy et al., 2007; Hilton et al., 2008; Kao et al., 2014), these settings are prone to rapid tectonic recycling, and carbon may reflux into the atmosphere, especially if the OCpetro is biologically-available or prone to physical decay. Graphitization by deep burial renders carbon more recalcitrant, which may limit losses during orogenic recycling (e.g. Galy et al., 2008). Survival rates of OCpetro during single cycles of erosion and deposition have been estimated at between 15% and 85%, with shorter distances between source and sink leading to better preservation (Galy et al., 2008; Hilton et al., 2008; Bouchez et al., 2010). With high survival rates, the ability for OCpetro to persist over multiple cycles of burial and exhumation is possible, but has not been demonstrated. Here, we address this knowledge gap, showing that in the rapidly exhuming mountains of Taiwan, highly graphitized OCpetro can escape degradation during repeated erosional cycles. This raises the prospect of progressive accumulation of POC in geological basins, provided that tectonic burial is sufficiently deep to drive graphitization.
published-S0016703718305271	Barnacles have been of long-standing scientific interest with detailed work on taxonomy and fossil forms reaching back to Charles Darwin (e.g., Darwin, 1851, 1854). Thoracican barnacles (subclass Cirripedia) first appeared in the Early Paleozoic (Briggs et al., 2005; Pérez-Losada et al., 2008) and developed shells of phosphatic composition (Gale and Schweigert, 2016). This basal clade is represented by the living genus Ibla, which has shell plates composed of a poorly ordered hydrogen-phosphate-like material (Reid et al., 2012). Thoracicans evolved shells of calcite in the Jurassic, and form a monophyletic clade called the Thoracicalcarea Gale (2016), which are abundant in the World’s oceans today. Calcareous barnacles first appeared in the Bathonian (mid-Jurassic), and by the end of the Jurassic (Tithonian) forms referred to the family Zeugmatolepadidae were abundant and widespread, mostly as epifauna attached to ammonite shells and driftwood (Gale, 2014, in press). In the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian) stalked benthonic cirripedes of the extant families Calanticidae and Scalpellidae appeared, which persist in deeper marine habitats to the present day (Gale, 2015). One group of stalked calcareous barnacles became epiplanktonic (lepadomorphs). Calcareous cirripedes first adapted to shallow marine hard substrates in the Late Cretaceous (Gale and Sørensen, 2015) and neobalanomorphs appeared in the Paleogene. These radiated rapidly, and by the Miocene these sessile forms were globally abundant and locally rock-forming in shallow marine habitats. Today they occupy a wide range of habitats from the intertidal zone down to deep sea trenches in the modern oceans (Foster, 1987). Calcareous barnacles secrete their shells onto a chitinous cuticle in a succession of very thin layers in synchronicity with the tidal cycle (Bourget, 1987) or endogenous semi-diurnal rhythm (Bourget and Crisp, 1975). The thin layers are composed of polycrystalline calcite crystals enveloped in organic macromolecules (Gal et al., 2015) and show hierarchical patterns. These hierarchical patterns relate to seasonal changes in growth rate and decreasing band with throughout ontogeny modulating the thickness of growth bands (Bourget and Crisp, 1975). After an initial planktic life stage, barnacles settle in their final larval stage and become sessile (Shanks, 1986), recording environmental conditions at their growth site during their adult life. Particular interest has been focussed on their attachment to various surfaces due to the negative economic impact of barnacle fouling (e.g., Christie and Dalley, 1987; Swain et al., 1998). The shells of barnacles have, however, also found use in ecological and environmental studies: δ13C and δ18O values of turtle and whale barnacles have been employed to trace the movement patterns of their host animals (Killingley, 1980; Killingley and Lutcavage, 1983) and a barnacle oxygen isotope thermometer has been established (Killingley and Newman, 1982). This barnacle thermometer has, for example, been employed in determining habitats of turtle barnacles (Detjen et al., 2015), and deciphering the point of origin of museum specimens (Newman and Killingley, 1985). Additionally, carbon isotope ratios in body tissues of intertidal barnacles have been identified as a potential proxy for habitat elevation with respect to the tidal level (Craven et al., 2008). Element/Ca ratios of barnacle shells have been studied and proposed as tracers of salinity (Gordon et al., 1970) and shore level (Pilkey and Harriss, 1966; Bourget, 1974). Significant inter-specimen differences in shell composition across different localities have additionally been identified as fingerprinting tool to locate harvest points of edible goose barnacles (Albuquerque et al., 2016). Despite such encouraging studies, not much is known about the chemical composition of barnacle shell material, and compilations of barnacle shell chemistry rely on very few samples (Chave, 1954; Dodd, 1967). From the few available data it has been noted that barnacle shell calcite is dissimilar from most commonly studied biogenic calcite as its very high Sr concentrations mean it plots off a proposed correlation line of Sr versus Mg content (Carpenter and Lohmann, 1992). Whether barnacles carry any species-specific element signatures and whether there are differences in element concentrations in their shell plates has, however, not been comprehensively addressed (but see Iglikowska et al., 2018a). Here we present δ13C and δ18O values as well as Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Mn/Ca and Fe/Ca ratios of 42 modern barnacle species of the Lepadiformes, Scalpelliformes, Verruciformes and Balaniformes (see Pérez-Losada et al., 2008 for taxonomic scheme), constituting the first large survey of shell geochemistry in cirripedes. These analyses are complemented by XRD analyses of 27 specimens to confirm the calcitic nature of the shell material. We compare the geochemical signatures of the shells with environmental parameters and evaluate taxonomic trends in shell composition. Furthermore, we investigate intra-shell chemical variability to address overall compositional heterogeneity and plate-specific chemical fingerprints.
published-S0021997515003138	In 1997, a newly emerged disease of the ovine digit was observed in the UK, the lesions of which led to severe clinical signs in affected animals (Harwood et al., 1997). The distinction between this disease and ovine foot rot was made by the differences in clinical appearance, the failure to respond to conventional foot rot therapies, and the isolation of Treponema spp. from the lesions, with and without concurrent detection of the causative agent of foot rot, Dichelobacter nodosus (Naylor et al., 1998; Davies et al., 1999; Lewis et al., 2001). The disease was named contagious ovine digital dermatitis (CODD) (Davies et al., 1999) and further work has since identified three Treponema phylogroups to be associated with clinical disease, namely Treponema medium/Treponema vincentii-like, Treponema phagedenis-like and Treponema pedis (Sullivan et al., 2015). These same three Treponema phylogroups are reported to be the cause of bovine digital dermatitis (BDD) (Evans et al., 2008), although not all BDD lesions may necessarily contain all three phylogroups (Evans et al., 2009). Recently, the clinical presentation of CODD was described in detail for the first time, and a five-point lesion grading system was proposed (Angell et al., 2015). In that study, the range of lesions was organized into a clinical progression of disease such that lesions progressed from grade 1 to 5. Briefly, the disease begins at the coronary band and extends distally, resulting in progressive, and eventually total, separation of the dorsal hoof wall. The lesions may resolve and new horn eventually replaces the horn lost in the fulminant stage of the disease, with some deformity of the regrown hoof. To date, there has been no histopathological characterization of these lesions or immunohistochemical investigation of the presence of Treponema spp. associated with the pathological changes. In cattle, immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been used to identify Treponema-like organisms in BDD lesions, and these are associated with hair follicles and sebaceous glands (Evans et al., 2009). In the present study, IHC was used to investigate the presence/absence of CODD-associated Treponema spp. It was considered that Treponema spp. would more likely be identified in earlier grades of lesion, particularly those of grade 1. The organisms may persist throughout all of the stages of the clinical disease, but might not be identifiable due to competition by secondary invaders, tissue necrosis or damage/removal by the immune system. The aims of this study were: (1) to describe the histopathological changes observed for each grade of clinical lesion and to investigate whether these grades reflected a progression of disease, and (2) to investigate whether the spirochaetes of the three phylogroups, T. medium/T. vincentii-like, T. phagedenis-like and T. pedis, were associated with clinical disease.
published-S0028390818300613	High-frequency action potential firing is essential for rapid information processing in the central nervous system, and in particular in the auditory system, which must encode complex auditory information with high fidelity (Carr, 1993; Joris and Yin, 2007; King et al., 2001). Kv3.1 K+ channels mediate currents with a high activation threshold and fast activation and deactivation kinetics, allowing for rapid action potential repolarization and short inter-spike intervals (Erisir et al., 1999; Rudy et al., 1999; Rudy and McBain, 2001). Kv3.1 K+ current activation and deactivation properties explain why those currents are critical for permitting high frequency firing of neurons. In accordance with this observation, Kv3.1 K+ currents are expressed in neurones firing at high frequency such as in the spinal cord (Deuchars et al., 2001), cortex (Erisir et al., 1999), cerebellum (Joho and Hurlock, 2009) and auditory nuclei (Wang et al., 1998). The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is an auditory brainstem structure playing a pivotal role in the integration of information from multiple sensory pathways (Wu and Martel, 2016) and in acoustic cues related to vertical sound source localization (May, 2000). DCN principal fusiform cells fire reliable and precise trains of action potentials in response to depolarizations (Ding et al., 1999; Hancock and Voigt, 2002a, b; Manis, 1990; Oertel and Wu, 1989; Pilati et al., 2008). Our previous study has shown that acoustic over-exposure triggers hearing loss, and this correlated with profound changes in the firing pattern and frequency of DCN fusiform cells (Pilati et al., 2012). After acoustic over-exposure, a proportion (∼40%) of DCN fusiform cells display a distinct bursting firing pattern which has been associated with reduced Kv3.1 K+ currents, losing the ability to fire regularly and at high firing frequencies (Finlayson and Kaltenbach, 2009; Pilati et al., 2012). DCN fusiform cells also exhibit increased spontaneous firing rates (Brozoski et al., 2002; Dehmel et al., 2012; Kaltenbach et al., 2004) and increased cross-unit synchrony and bursting of spontaneous firing which correlate with behavioural measures of tinnitus (Finlayson and Kaltenbach, 2009; Kaltenbach et al., 1998; Wu and Martel, 2016). Despite evidence demonstrating firing frequency modulation and burst induction within the DCN (Finlayson and Kaltenbach, 2009; Pilati et al., 2012), the role of Kv3.1 K+ currents in DCN fusiform cell spike-timing remains unexplored. In this study we explore the effects of Kv3.1 K+ currents on the firing frequency and spike-timing of DCN fusiform cells. We used tetraethylammonium (TEA), a K+ channel blocker known to inhibit the Kv3 K+ currents at low concentrations (IC50 ∼0.3 mm) (Critz et al., 1993; Grissmer et al., 1994; Hernandez-Pineda et al., 1999; Johnston et al., 2010; Kanemasa et al., 1995) and acoustic over-exposure to trigger a down-regulation of high voltage-activated (Kv3 type) K+ currents (Pilati et al., 2012), to test the disruptive effects on spike timing. Firing precision of DCN fusiform cells was assessed using an analysis of the coefficient of variation (Pilati et al., 2012), and spike-time reliability was assessed by measuring the ability of the fusiform cell to fire consistently across repeated trials with the same current stimulus (Joris et al., 2006). Until recently, the exploration of the role of Kv3 K+ channels in neurophysiology has been hampered by the absence of pharmacological tools. However, the compound (5R)-5-ethyl-3-(6-((4-methyl-3-(methyloxy)phenyl)oxy)-3-pyridinyl)-2,4-imidazolidinedione, (AUT1) has been shown to be a selective Kv3.1/3.2 K+ channel modulator (Rosato-Siri et al., 2015) increasing the open probability of Kv3 K+ channels, and shifting the voltage-dependence of activation of Kv3.1/3.2 K+ currents to more negative potentials (Brown et al., 2016; Rosato-Siri et al., 2015; Taskin et al., 2015). Here, we used AUT1 in the presence of a low concentration of TEA, or after acoustic over-exposure, to test whether positive modulation of Kv3.1 K+ currents could rescue impaired DCN fusiform cell firing precision and spike-time reliability. Spike-timing depends upon various factors including the membrane time constant (Azouz and Gray, 2000), voltage-gated ion channels (Azouz and Gray, 2000; Fricker and Miles, 2000; Higgs and Spain, 2011; Jaeger and Bower, 1999), the coincident activation of pre-synaptic neurones (Diesmann et al., 1999; Gauck and Jaeger, 2003; Grande et al., 2004; Grothe and Sanes, 1994), and/or baseline spontaneous membrane voltage fluctuations (Dorval and White, 2005; Jaeger and Bower, 1999). We therefore tested whether modulation on spike-timing was dependent on baseline spontaneous membrane voltage fluctuations. As TEA (Erisir et al., 1999; Wang et al., 1998) and acoustic over-exposure (Pilati et al., 2012) reduced the amplitude of DCN fusiform cell action potential after-hyperpolarization, we also tested whether firing precision and spike-time reliability were dependent on the action potential after hyperpolarization. Our study shows that Kv3.1 K+ currents control the spike-timing in DCN fusiform cells, via an effect on the action potential after-hyperpolarization and on spontaneous membrane voltage fluctuations. Our study further suggests Kv3.1 K+ currents act as a potential target to restore action potential fidelity following acoustic trauma.
