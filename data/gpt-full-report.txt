Abstract
This is an experiment in using GPT-4, the premium version of ChatGPT, to complete an entire data analysis report. The latest versions can write and run Python code, and can read CSV files you provide. We uploaded a dataset used in our Ph.D. regression course and provided GPT-4 with an explanation of the data copied from the description provided to students, then asked it research questions based on those asked of our Ph.D. students. It wrote the Python code to conduct the analysis, ran it, and interpreted the results. When we asked it to write the report, we proceeded section by section, and gave it excerpts from the rubric given to students. In other words, we only provided the same material provided to students in the Ph.D. course.
An annotated transcript of the ChatGPT session, including the Python code it generated and ran, is also provided in the Supplementary Materials. Note that we didn’t push back on GPT-4's writing to suggest changes; undoubtedly we could do that to get better results, but we want to illustrate what GPT-4 can achieve even without an expert holding its hand.
The results are presented below without modification, except to format them in LATEX. Notes in the margin are by the authors.
1. Introduction
The proliferation of rail trails, created from old, unused railway lines, has become a unique feature of urban and suburban landscapes across the United States. These trails, typically long and paved with gentle slopes, provide an easily accessible avenue for outdoor activities such as walking and biking. In the city of Northampton, Massachusetts, a rail trail was established in 1984, providing a potential amenity for residents in the area.
In the context of real estate, an ongoing question of interest is how proximity to such amenities influences property values. It is hypothesized that properties closer to a rail trail could command higher prices due to the added convenience and recreational opportunities. Moreover, properties near these trails may appreciate more over time if buyers are willing to pay a premium for this feature. This study sets out to explore these questions, with a particular focus on how property values have changed over time in relation to their distance from the rail trail.
To test these theories, we utilize a dataset of 104 homes in the Northampton area that were sold in 2007. The data includes home features such as size, number of bedrooms, size of the property, and number of garage parking spaces, as well as the distance to the nearest rail trail. Home values in 1998 and 2014 were estimated using Zillow’s value estimator, which takes into account sale prices, prices of nearby similar homes, and features of the home.
This investigation has significant implications for homeowners, prospective buyers, real estate agents, and urban planners. For homeowners and buyers, understanding the relationship between rail trails and property values can inform purchasing and selling decisions. For real estate agents, such insights can guide pricing strategies and marketing efforts. For urban planners, the findings can contribute to informed decisions about the development and promotion of rail trails and other recreational amenities.
In the following sections, we detail the methods used to analyze the data, present our findings, and discuss their implications.
2. Methods
To investigate the impact of proximity to the rail trail on home values in Northampton, we conducted a multivariate linear regression analysis. This analysis method was chosen as it allows us to estimate the relationship between multiple independent variables and a continuous dependent variable, while controlling for potential confounding factors. Our dependent variable was the percentage change in home prices from 1998 to 2014. Our primary independent variable was the distance of a property to the nearest rail trail, measured in miles. We controlled for home features, including the size of the home (square feet), the number of bedrooms (bedrooms), the size of the property (acre), and the number of garage parking spaces (garage_spaces).
The choice of these control variables was based on the understanding that these are key factors that typically influence home values. The size of a home and the number of bedrooms are direct indicators of the amount of living space, which is a major determinant of home price. The size of the property provides additional usable outdoor space, which could also affect a home’s value. The number of garage parking spaces can add convenience for homeowners and can potentially increase a home’s value.
The data was checked for linearity, normality of residuals, and homoskedasticity, which are key assumptions for linear regression. Linearity was visually assessed using scatter plots, and the normality of residuals was evaluated using a Q-Q plot. Homoskedasticity was tested using the Breusch–Pagan test.
The multivariate linear regression model was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. It allows us to estimate the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable, holding all other variables constant. Alternative models such as polynomial regression or non-linear regression could have been considered if the relationships between the variables were not linear. However, visual inspection of scatter plots suggested that the relationships were approximately linear. Therefore, a linear regression model was deemed appropriate for this analysis.
While this analysis provides valuable insights, there are some limitations to consider.
The model assumes that the relationships between the independent and dependent variables are linear and that the errors are normally distributed and have constant variance. Violations of these assumptions can lead to biased or inefficient estimates. In addition, the analysis does not account for other potentially important factors, such as the age and condition of the home, neighborhood characteristics, and macroeconomic conditions, which could also affect home prices.
3. Results
Our multivariate linear regression analysis provided estimates of the relationship between the percentage change in home prices from 1998 to 2014 and several home characteristics, including distance to the nearest rail trail.
For our primary independent variable, distance to the nearest rail trail, the estimated coefficient was 6.3274. This suggests that for each additional mile a home is from the nearest rail trail, we expect the percentage change in home price from 1998 to 2014 to increase by approximately 6.33 percentage points, holding all other variables constant. However, the p-value associated with this coefficient was 0.201, which is above the common significance threshold of 0.05. Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the distance to the nearest rail trail is zero. This suggests that, after controlling for other factors, the distance to the nearest rail trail does not have a statistically significant effect on the percentage change in home prices.
The size of the home (square feet) had a positive effect on the percentage change in home price, with an estimated coefficient of 22.6403. This means that for each additional 1000 square feet of home size, we expect the percentage change in home price to increase by approximately 22.64 percentage points, holding all other variables constant. The p-value for this coefficient was 0.053, which is just above the significance threshold of 0.05, suggesting that this result is marginally significant.
The number of bedrooms (bedrooms) and the number of garage parking spaces (garage_spaces) did not have statistically significant effects on the percentage change in home prices. Their coefficients were −7.5659 (p = 0.233) and 5.8699 (p = 0.262), respectively.
The size of the property (acre) had a statistically significant negative effect on the percentage change in home prices. The estimated coefficient was −140.0904 (p < 0.001), suggesting that for each additional acre of property size, we expect the percentage change in home price to decrease by approximately 140.09 percentage points, holding all other variables constant.
The R-squared value of the model was 0.173, indicating that approximately 17.3% of the variability in the percentage change in home prices can be explained by the model. The F-statistic was 4.106 with a p-value of 0.00199, suggesting that the overall model is statistically significant.
4. Discussion
This study aimed to investigate the impact of proximity to a rail trail on home prices in Northampton, Massachusetts. We hypothesized that homes closer to the rail trail would appreciate more over the period from 1998 to 2014, after controlling for home features such as size, number of bedrooms, size of the property, and number of garage parking spaces.
Our multivariate linear regression analysis did not provide statistically significant evidence to support this hypothesis. The estimated effect of distance to the nearest rail trail on the percentage change in home prices was positive, contrary to the expected negative relationship, but not statistically significant. This suggests that proximity to the rail trail may not have a substantial impact on home price appreciation, at least not one that is detectable with the data and methods used in this study.
On the other hand, we found that the size of the property had a statistically significant negative effect on the percentage change in home prices. This suggests that larger properties may have appreciated less over the period from 1998 to 2014. The size of the home had a positive effect on the percentage change in home prices, but this effect was only marginally significant.
There are several limitations to our analysis. The model assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, which may not hold true in reality. Moreover, there are likely other factors that affect home prices that we did not include in the model, such as the age and condition of the home, neighborhood characteristics, and macroeconomic conditions. The model also showed evidence of heteroskedasticity, which suggests that the variance of the errors is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. This could potentially affect the efficiency of our estimates.
Future research could address these limitations by including additional relevant variables in the model, exploring non-linear relationships, or using a different type of model that can handle heteroskedasticity better. Despite these limitations, our study provides valuable insights into the factors that influence home price appreciation in Northampton, which can inform decisions of homeowners, prospective buyers, real estate agents, and urban planners.
